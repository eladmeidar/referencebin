<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="first">Prb is founded on the principles of helping people to discover new information by
     enabling them to share what they find interesting with one another.  Prb knows that you care
      about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy very
       seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting
        the Prb website, you are accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers Prb's treatment of personal information that Prb gathers when you
     are on the Prb website and when you use Prb services. This policy does not apply to the
      practices of third parties that Prb does not own or control, or to individuals that Prb
       does not employ or manage.</p>

<h3>Information Collected by Prb</h3>
<p class="first">We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of our
     website, which is to enable users to discover and share information with one another. This
      information allows us to provide you with a customized and efficient experience. We do not
       process this information in a way that is incompatible with this objective. We collect
        the following types of information from our Prb users:</p>
<ol>
<li>Information You Provide to Us:
<br />We receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any
 other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not
  be able to take advantage of many of our special features.
<ul>
<li>Registration: In order for you to use Prb services, such as submitting new links to the
     website, you must complete a registration form. As part of this registration form, we
      require select personal information (including your full name, city, state and e-mail
       address).    </li>
<li>User Profile: To allow you to express yourself beyond just the information collected during
     registration, we enable you to provide additional information, such as a bio, favorite URLs,
      and instant messaging IDs.  In addition, you may choose to include photos of yourself in
       your profile.  As indicated below, in the section titled "Sharing Your Information", you
        can control how your information is displayed and used.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Automatic Information: 
<br />
<ul>
<li>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. Prb and its
     authorized agents automatically receive and record certain "traffic data" on their server
      logs from your browser including your IP address, Prb cookie information, and the page you
       requested. Prb uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers, analyze
        trends and administer the website.</li>
<li>Prb may collect and, on any page, display the total counts that page has been viewed. This
     includes User Profile pages.</li>
<li>Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously. While Prb will
     not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we
      want you to be aware that these programs are available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>E-mail Communications</h3>
<p class="first">Prb is very concerned about your privacy and we will never provide your email
     address to a third party without your explicit permission, as detailed in the "Sharing Your
      Information" section below. Prb may send out e-mails with Prb-related news, products, offers,
       surveys or promotions.  You may also receive notification e-mails from Prb, which inform you
        of actions (e.g. friend requests) that have been performed on the site.  If you do not want
         to receive e-mail from us, please visit the <a href="/settings/email">Email  Preferences</a>
          section of your User Profile and/or follow the instructions contained in the unwanted
           e-mail message.  However, please note that in all cases you will continue to receive all
            system e-mails (e.g. those regarding forgotten user passwords) and legal notices (e.g.
             updates to our policies) from us.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through
     your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when
      pages in our website are visited and by how many people. Prb cookies do not collect
       personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with
        other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or e-mail
         address is.
</li>
<li>The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to
     prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you
      when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We recommend that you
       leave the cookies activated because cookies allow you to use some of Prb's coolest
        features.
</li>
<li>Some of our business partners, like our advertisers, may use cookies on our website. We
     have no access to, or control over, these cookies.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sharing Your Information</h3>
<p class="first">Because Prb enables people to discover and share information with one
     another, information about the people who use Prb is an integral part of the Prb
      experience. Rest assured that we neither rent nor sell your personal information to
       anyone and that we will share your personal information only as described below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Prb Personnel:
Prb personnel and authorized consultants and/or contractors may have access to user
 information if necessary in the normal course of Prb business.
</li>
<li>Business Transfers: 
In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user
 information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if
  Prb, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one
   of the assets that is transferred.</li>
<li>Protection of Prb and Others:
We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary
 to comply with a  law; to enforce or apply our <a href="/tou">Terms of Use</a> and other
  policies; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Prb, our employees, our users,
   or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations
    for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
<li>User Profile information:
Information collected during registration and subsequent visits, such as your full name
 and location, may be displayed to other Prb users in your User Profile.  The User Profile
  is the area on Prb where we allow you to tell other Prb users about yourself and your
   interests.  You may control what personal information is displayed in your User Profile
    by visiting the <a href="/settings">Privacy Settings</a> section of your User Profile.</li>
<li>Member Directory:
The e-mail address that you submit upon registration will be searchable by other Prb users
 who know you by your email address, unless you choose to opt out of this feature. This is
  primarily so that other users can find you to establish friendship through Prb.  You may
   opt-out of this feature by visiting the <a href="/settings">Privacy Settings</a> section
    of your User Profile.</li>
<li>Social sharing of data:
Prb allows other users to browse stories that you have Dugg, submitted or commented on. This information is made available publicly via your User Profile, on Prb Labs (<a href="http://labs.prb.com">labs.prb.com</a>), via the public <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym> (<a href="http://services.prb.com">services.prb.com</a>), or within the permalink URL of the story on which you performed the action. Prb may choose to post this data on
    other site features.</li>
<li>Friends' Activity:
Much like other online social networks, Prb allows non-friends to browse your friends' activity (
prb.com/users/usersname/friends).</li>
<li>API:
Prb will allow third parties access to all Prb data this is already publicly available
 through the Prb website. Prb will keep private any passwords.</li>
<li>Syndication:
Prb allows for the RSS syndication of all of its public content within the Prb website.
</li>
<li>With Your Consent:
Except as noted above, we will contact you when your personal information is shared with
 third parties or used for a purpose incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was
  originally collected, and you will be able to opt out to prevent the sharing of this
   information. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Keeping Information Secure</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your Prb account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security.
     Protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by logging
      off once you have finished using a shared computer.</li>
<li>Only employees who need personal information to perform a specific job (for example,
     a customer service representative) are granted access to it. All of our employees are
      kept up to date on our privacy and security practices.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ways to Control Display and Use of Your Information</h3>
<ul>
<li>As stated previously, you can always opt not to disclose information, but then you may
     be unable to use certain features on our website, such as posting new links.</li>
<li>By visiting your User Profile, you can correct, amend, add or delete personal
     information on our website. When you update information, however, we often maintain
      a copy of the unrevised information in our records.</li>
<li>You may request deletion of your Prb account by e-mailing us at 
    <a href="mailto:support@prb.com">support@prb.com</a>.</li>
<li>If you do not wish to receive e-mail from us or other Prb users, please visit the 
    <a href="/settings/email">Email  Preferences</a> section of your User Profile and/or
     follow the instructions contained in the unwanted e-mail message.</li>
<li>However, please note that you will continue to receive all system e-mails (e.g. those
     regarding forgotten user passwords) and legal notices (e.g. updates to our policies)
      from us.</li>
<li>If you do not wish to have people who know you by your email address find you via the
     Member Directory service, please visit the <a href="/settings">Privacy Settings</a>
      section of your User Profile to opt out of this feature.</li>
<li>As explained earlier, the "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers
     will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to
      command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully
       disable cookies. Please note, however, that if your browser does not accept
        cookies, you will not be able to take advantage of some of our attractive
         features.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Children Under 18 Years of Age</h3>
<p class="first">You must be 13 years and older to register to use the Prb website.
     As a result, Prb does not specifically collect information about children. If we
      learn that Prb has collected information from a child under the age of 13, we will
       delete that information as quickly as possible. We recommend that minors between
        the ages of 13 and 18 ask and receive their parents' permission before using Prb
         or sending information about themselves or anyone else over the Internet.</p>
<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p class="first">Prb may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, at its sole
     discretion. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy
      in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes to the Privacy
       Policy, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Prb website so you
        are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what
         circumstances if any, it is disclosed.</p>
<h3>Conditions of Use</h3>
<p class="first">If you decide to visit Prb website, your visit and any possible
     dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our <a href="/tou">Terms
          of Use</a>, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and
           application of California state law.</p>
<h3>Effective Date of this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p class="first">This Privacy Policy is effective as of February 1, 2006 and last
     updated September 19, 2007.</p>
